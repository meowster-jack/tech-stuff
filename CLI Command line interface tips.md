There are many useful Command Line Interface Apps and there are situations you may need to use a command and and in some cases the command line is just faster than Graphical User Interface (GUIs).

The CL can basically do everything GUIs can. Ever wonder why you shouldn't run random .exe files? its because they do stuff and some do it in the command line (PowerShell or command prompt in windows)

That is why you shouldn't run random apps and scripts with admin privileges. Only if you trust the app and know what you are doing run C prompt or PowerShell with admin privileges.

You can use package managers like chocolatey winget etc in windows to easily install apps in my experience it is just better this way sometimes and even faster but for some instances GUIs are better because they make things easier.   

The obvious problem is that you will have to know certain commands and know how to do stuff. You can easily find them online it doesn't take more than 10 minutes to learn how to do things in the command line like copy pasting files and moving inside directories. You will need to know these stuff if you want to run command line apps like OCRmypdf, YT-DLP, ffmpeg etc. However there are also GUI versions of some CLI apps so yay!

Linux users will probably understand a lot more things useful about the command line and Linux systems use CL more often than windows.

Read official documentation they are your friend! they will guide you through the entire thing. 

for eg: [cd | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cd) 

ctrl + insert 
right click to paste 
cd tab

look up navigation in command line

This guide actually is not specifically for CL but for a CLI app but it shows how to do some stuff
